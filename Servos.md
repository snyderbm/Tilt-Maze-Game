The Servos I Used in this project are the SG90 Micro servo Motors.
I used two of these motors. The servo motors work by mapping out locations of the joy stick 
to the positions of the servo motor. The delay helped slightly with the speed of the motors.
The more interesting part of the project was setting up an orientation of the motors to have
motion in both the X and the Y axis. The device I chose to use is the same technology that 
is used in a gimbal. By attaching the Y servo side to the x axis servo and then attaching an L-bracket 
to the Y axis servo this creates a gimbal that gives free rotation about both the X and Y Axis.
