My individual project is going to be a maze. To solve this maze you will need to navigate a marble through the maze.
To move the marble, a joystick that controls that maze platform will tilt the maze in the direction you desire. 
The marble will then fall due to gravity until you have successfully completed the maze. 

This project will be done using an arduino uno, 2 servo motor, a joystick module, along with the necessary hardware to build the maze.
